# SteamworksPy
This experimental branch is meant to test out things that aren't really stable for release yet.  Currently it is being used to test out the Flat API system.  Same rules apply for getting it to work as they do for the master branch.

Feel free to fork or contribute to this module.

Pre-builds for Windows and Linux here: https://github.com/Gramps/SteamworksPy/releases

Full documentation on getting started is now available here: https://gramps.github.io/SteamworksPy/

## Usage
